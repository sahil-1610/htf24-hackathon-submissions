Appwrite Products Used

Appwrite Databases
I used Appwrite Databases to store and manage data related to users, appointments, and other relevant information. The NoSQL database provided by Appwrite allowed me to structure the data efficiently and retrieve it seamlessly when needed.

Appwrite Storage
I used Appwrite Storage for storing files, such as user-uploaded documents, images, or other media. It ensured secure and scalable storage with easy access and management through the backend.

Appwrite Authentication
I used Appwrite Authentication to manage user accounts, allowing users to sign up, log in, and access their profiles securely. The built-in authentication features like email/password and OAuth simplified the process of securing the app.

Appwrite Functions
I used Appwrite Functions to handle custom backend logic, such as sending email notifications or processing data after user actions. It allowed me to write and execute server-side code easily.

Appwrite Email
I used Appwrite's email service to send confirmation emails, notifications, and other communication directly to users.
